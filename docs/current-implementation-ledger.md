## Locked Workflow Rules

- Inspect first.
- Do not duplicate UI/API/helpers/tests/docs.
- Do not add → remove → replace loop.
- Reuse existing setup-only foundations.
- Terminal 2 checks before Codex whenever possible.
- No live DB, migrations, payment, PDF, payout, auth activation, live sending, external APIs, live location, or photo upload unless explicitly approved.
- After every Codex task, provide a short "ChatGPT record message" for the user to paste back into ChatGPT. Include implementation commit if any, ledger/docs commit if any, files changed, checks run, final `git status --short`, applicable boundaries (no live DB/provider/env/sending/payment/etc.), and next suggested task if obvious.

## Required Check Lock

| Task type | Required checks |
| --- | --- |
| Docs-only ledger update | `git diff --check`, `git status --short` |
| Helper/setup foundation | Direct contract test, `git diff --check`, `git status --short` |
| API route | API contract test + related helper test, `git diff --check`, `git status --short` |
| Compact UI change | Relevant test if any + `npm run lint`; build only if risky |
| Big UI/page change | `npm run lint` + `npm run build` |
| Live DB/API/payment/auth/provider changes | Full relevant tests + lint + build + smoke |
